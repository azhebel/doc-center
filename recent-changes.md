# Viewing Recent Changes

Besides the detailed [*Local History*](README.md),
IntelliJ IDEA provides a summary of major recent changes to all projects.

To view recent changes, open the **View** menu and choose **Recent Changes**.

You can select the change you are interested in to review differences and revert it if necessary.
