# Adding Labels to Local History

[*Local History*](README.dm) contains revisions with timestamps, which are not easy to navigate.
Some revisions are automatically marked with labels based on predefined events:
running tests, deploying apps, committing changes, etc.
You can also add custom labels to mark specific milestones in your *Local History*.

To add a label to the current revision:

1. Open the **VCS** menu and choose **Local History** > **Put Label**.

2. In the **Put Label** dialog box, type the label name and click **OK**.
