# Sharing Local History

[*Local History*](README.md) does not support shared access, it is intended only for personal use.
However, you can create a *patch* file with changes relative to a specific revision, which you can share with others.

To generate a patch, select the relevant revision in *Local History* and click **Create Patch** in the toolbar.
