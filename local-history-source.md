# Viewing Local History for Source Code Elements

In some cases, you may not want to see [*Local History*](README.md) for the whole file,
but only separate source code elements:
classes, their members (fields and methods), or any selected fragment of text.

* To view *Local History* for a class, right-click the class name in the editor, then select **Local History** > **Show History for Class**.

* To view *Local History* for a class field, right-click the field name in the editor, then select **Local History** > **Show History for Field**.

* To view *Local History* for a class method, right-click the method name in the editor, then select **Local History** > **Show History for Method**.

* To view *Local History* for a source code fragment, right-click the selected text in the editor, then select **Local History** > **Show History for Selection**.
